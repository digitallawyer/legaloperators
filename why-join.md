**What’s involved with the application process?**

To <a href="/join">apply</a>, you’ll need to fill out a short questionnaire about you and your background. We will review your application and may request additional verification of your background, in particular if you were not referred through another community member or did not apply with your professional email address. The application takes less than 2 minutes to complete.

**How to know if you’re the right fit?**

You have a background in legal operations, whether you are just starting out or are already far-advanced in your career. You take your work very seriously, and are looking for a place where you can get smarter, faster. If you get all that, you’re in the right place. It’s a community of legal operations professionals with their ties loosened, cutting up and mentoring each other.

**What should you expect?**

A thriving and vibrant place to check out on a daily basis. Each day you’ll find new and relevant discussions, industry news, and questions posed from other legal operations professionals. The community uses our private Slack group.

This is not a group of lurkers. Every member typically gives as much as he or she receives from the community. Our members will be the first to tell you that this community is guaranteed to help you move your career in a better direction.

**Is there a fee?**

There is currently no fee to become a member. Our community is for people who want to better themselves and their practice – while having some fun. We want each and every one of our member’s to be a contributor and member for life.
